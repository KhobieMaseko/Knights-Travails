# Knight's Travails

A JavaScript implementation of a knight's shortest path on a chessboard for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## Features

- Finds the shortest path for a knight between any two positions on a chessboard
- Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm
- Validates all moves to prevent going off the board
- Clean output showing the path and number of moves

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KhobieMaseko/Knights-Travails.git
cd Knights-Travails
```

## Testing

```bash
node driver.js
```

Example Output:

```bash
You made it in 2 moves! Here's your path:
[0, 0]
[1, 2]
[3, 3]
```
